  <h2>Shelter to Soldier</h2>
  <p>Shelter to Soldier is a non-profit located in Oceanside, California.  Their moto:” SAVING LIVES, TWO AT A TIME™” is the perfect summary of what they do as they bring post-9/11 combat veterans together with trained rescue dogs and as in their words they “help both recover and move forward.”  We chose this non-profit because we loved how they were helping not only the animals but also our veterans at the same time.</p>

<div class="box row3">
  <h2>The Problem</h2>
  <p>Veterans with accessibility challenges due to PTSD, and traumatic brain injury need a clear application process when they are applying for a therapy dog.</p>
  <div class="redline"><div class="numberCircle">1</div><p>Hard to read text & different font types</p></div>
  <div class="redline"><div class="numberCircle">2</div><p>Drop down could be used to make UX easier and decrease errors</p></div>
  <div class="redline"><div class="numberCircle">3</div><p>No primary/secondary button style difference.  Previous and next buttons don't show up until page 3</p></div>
  <div class="redline"><div class="numberCircle">4</div><p>If you use the browser back buttons then you lose your info.  Needs account login to save spot</p></div>
  <div class="redline"><div class="numberCircle">5</div><p>Documents needed should be listed first to reduce the number of abandoned unfinished applications.</p></div>
  <div class="redline"><div class="numberCircle">6</div><p>Avoid large text boxes to reduce errors.  This one could have 2 columns with one listing a date drop down and the other the location of the employment.  Other questions similar to this with large text boxes.  Asks applicant to list who lives in the household with them.</p></div>

<div class="box row3b">
  <h2>Our Hypothesis</h2>
  <p>We believe that by streamlining the application process, veterans with accessibility challenges will achieve greater application success while reducing abandoned applications.  In the future Shelter to Soldier could track their abandoned application rate to see if our changes made a difference.</p>
  <div class="bullets">
  <div>• Ability to create and account and save progress</div>
  <div>• Ability to clearly see process and what documentation is required</div>
  <div>• Decrease use of large text boxes and instead create information chunking to decrease errors. </div>

<div class="box row8"><p>We defined two separate user personas: one being the donor and one being the veteran applicant.  Knowing that the Veteran might have potentially significant challenges due to their injuries we hypothesized they might need a clear and straight forward application process.</p></div>

<div class="box row11"><p>Our color scheme is similar to the current one but we added a bit more brightness to make it more exciting.  We also took the logo and restructured the text so it could fit in a smaller space.</p></div>
